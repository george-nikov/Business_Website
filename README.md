# Business_Website
This is a Dental care website made for a dental care clinic based in Bulgaria. 
For my frontend I used Bootstrap and Ajax. 
My backend is based on Express Server using MySQL as my database and XAMPP Apache Server as hosting. 
Through the contact form the customer can write down their first and last name and mobile number to book an appointment with a dentist. By clicking Submit the contact form interacts with the Express server which sends responds to the MySQL server saving the personal information for each customer in a table.
