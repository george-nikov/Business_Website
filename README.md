# Business_Website
This is a Dental care website made for a dental care clinic based in Bulgaria to better introduce their business and the services they provide. I also added a contact form through which customers could easily book an appointment with a dentist. 
For designing the website, the frontend I built with Bootstrap and Ajax. 
My backend is based on Express Server using MySQL as my database and XAMPP Apache Server as hosting. 
Through the contact form the customer can write down their first and last name and mobile number to book an appointment with a dentist. By clicking Submit the contact form interacts with the Express server which sends responds to the MySQL server saving the personal information for each customer in a table. I could have done the connection between my website and the database using PHP, but my programming teacher showed me a much easier way to do the same work more efficiently and more easy to understand. So I followed his advice. 
The website also presents photos of the clinic and the services they provide as well as contact information and location.
